# tf-file-organize configuration file
# Define matching patterns for resource types and file names
#
# Pattern matching priority (checked in order from top to bottom):
# 1. block_type.sub_type.name  Example: "output.vpc_id.main", "resource.aws_instance.web"
# 2. block_type.sub_type       Example: "output.vpc_id", "resource.aws_instance"
# 3. sub_type                  Example: "vpc_id", "aws_instance"
# 4. block_type                Example: "output", "resource"
#
# Wildcard support:
# - "*"      : Any string
# - "vpc_*"  : Starts with "vpc_"
# - "*_ip"   : Ends with "_ip"
# - "web*db" : Starts with "web" and ends with "db"
#
# exclude_files: Exclude grouping by file name patterns
# - If grouped files match this pattern, they are kept as individual files
